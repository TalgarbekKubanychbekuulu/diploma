            Italian Lamborghini boilers are technologically advanced, but
            extremely expensive boiler units, which explains their low
            prevalence and demand. Gas models have excellent characteristics
            close to the best boilers in their price segment, are made of
            high-quality alloys, are perfectly arranged and assembled, have a
            wide range of protective systems and easy, almost fully automatic
            control. However, in terms of reliability, they are still inferior
            to the reference German counterparts.

            depending on the power of the power unit and in real time. Sensors
            tirelessly signal the control unit, where the analysis of the system

            The company has experienced ups and downs, leaving the brand to be
            considered a legendary example of the author's expression of
            engineering. The first Lamborghini engine saw the light in the debut
            line of cars. Today's assembly differs in many ways from the
            features of the assembly processes of past years. Previously, the
            work was carried out by several craftsmen in small workshops with a
            pair of milling machines. “Horses” have been added to modern
            products: now these are devices with 700 hp. with. at 6500 rpm. The
            numbers are impressive! In the process of creating a cylinder block,
            light aluminum alloys are used for the production of heads, allowing
            you to reduce the weight of the car to 235 kg. The engine differs
            from the former "brothers" in more compact dimensions. This option
            is used on the modification of the top Murcielago. What else

            dollars. The last restyling happened in 2013, being equipped with a
            V10 with a capacity of 560 “horses”. Motorists who have become
            owners of the first models want to add power characteristics, and
            some tuning studios are able to change the usual parameters. As a
            result, products with Lamborghini engine power up to 1,200 hp travel
            around the world. with. This is explained simply: in the basic
            configuration of the Gallardo, turbines are not used. The company,
            in an attempt to get away from conservatism, abandoned turbocharged
            engines in 2012, despite the then "boom" regarding such units -
